  response +=
    "1. **Short-term Production Acceleration:** Our data shows a 4.2% increase in gas consumption by rubber glove manufacturers in the PRK and JHR regions immediately following tariff announcements. This suggests manufacturers accelerated production to ship inventory before tariff implementation dates.\n\n"

  response +=
    "2. **Mid-term Volume Reduction:** Following the initial surge, we've observed a 6.7% decrease in gas consumption compared to budget in the last quarter. This aligns with news reports indicating manufacturers are optimizing production efficiency to offset increased export costs.\n\n"

  response +=
    "3. **Regional Production Shifts:** The most significant impact is seen in the PKP area, where our largest rubber glove customers are located. Gas consumption has decreased by 8.3% as some manufacturers appear to be shifting production to facilities in countries not affected by the tariffs.\n\n"

  response += "- Continued below-budget gas consumption (-5% to -8%) for the next two quarters\n"
